## Introduction

The Skin Cancer Predictor is a machine learning model that uses a dataset of skin images to predict the likelihood of skin cancer. It can assist in early detection of skin cancer by analyzing the features of skin lesions and providing a probability score for malignancy. This tool can be used for both medical professionals and individuals interested in monitoring their skin health.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of skin cancer based on skin lesion images.
- Provides a probability score for malignancy.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images.
- Can assist medical professionals in early skin cancer detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-predictor.git
   cd skin-cancer-predictor
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Skin Cancer Predictor.

3. Upload an image of a skin lesion for analysis.

4. The model will provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of skin cancer.

## Model Training

If you want to retrain the skin cancer prediction model with your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.

2. Update the model training script with your dataset and model architecture.

3. Run the training script to train the model.

4. Save the trained model and update the application with the new model weights.

## Dataset

The skin cancer predictor uses a dataset of skin lesion images for training and prediction. You can find the dataset used in this project in the `dataset` folder. If you plan to use your own dataset, make sure it is properly labeled and structured for training.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated. These metrics help assess the model's ability to correctly predict skin cancer. You can find the evaluation results in the `evaluation` folder.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the Skin Cancer Predictor project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

3. Make your changes and submit a pull request.

4. Your contribution will be reviewed and merged if it meets the project's standards.
