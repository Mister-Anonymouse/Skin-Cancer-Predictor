## Introduction

The Skin Cancer Predictor is a machine learning model that uses a dataset of skin images to predict the likelihood of skin cancer. It can assist in early detection of skin cancer by analyzing the features of skin lesions and providing a probability score for malignancy. This tool can be used for both medical professionals and individuals interested in monitoring their skin health.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of skin cancer based on skin lesion images.
- Provides a probability score for malignancy.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images.
- Can assist medical professionals in early skin cancer detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

  Download the Jupyter Notebook from the releases tab:
  
  https://github.com/Mister-Anonymouse/Skin-Cancer-Predictor/releases

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in any preferred Python IDE.

2. Run the codes in all the code cell.

4. Upload an image of a skin lesion for analysis.

5. The model will provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of skin cancer.

## Dataset

The skin cancer predictor uses a dataset of skin lesion images for training and prediction. You can find the dataset used in this project in the `scd` folder. If you plan to use your own dataset, make sure it is properly labeled and structured for training.
